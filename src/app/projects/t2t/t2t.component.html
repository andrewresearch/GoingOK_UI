<h3>National Transition to Teaching Project</h3>
<div><p>Innovative responses are needed to address longstanding concerns about how early career teachers (ECTs) transition into the first year of teaching. ECTs who desire to be critical and capable professionals navigate high expectations and daunting attrition statistics at a time when they are moving between systems of support at university to employment. This project is designed around an open access digital reflective tool - GoingOk - that was designed with beginning teachers to support their transition between university professional experience and in their first year as they created digital reflections that accumulated into digital plotlines. These reflexive digital plotlines provide rich qualitative and quantitative data that values both ECT wellbeing and performance standards as indicators of quality ECT teacher experiences. Learning analytics enable swift recognition of patterns in large data sets, that are then validated through ECT and employer through focus groups. This approach has been piloted successfully in two Australian universities and with one employer group and has proven to be an evaluative process that enables individual reflexivity to affirm the agency of beginning teachers as well as provide timely feedback loops to organisations. This project extends the pilot to multiple university sites.</p></div>


<div>University partners will:
  <ul>
    <li>Enable preservice teachers in their final year of teaching  to use the digital tool GoingOk.com as part of their professional experience reflective practice.</li>
    <li>Encourage preservice teachers to continue using the GoingOk reflective tool during their transition into teaching.</li>
    <li>Access online analytic reports identifying patterns of strengths and challenges for their own preservice teacher and ECT alumni.</li>
    <li>Benchmark issues for their own institution's data against the aggregated multiple university data from ECTs.</li>
    <li>Be involved in various validation forums with ECTs, colleagues, employers to explore ways to feedforward innovative responses into initial teacher education programs and employer support programs.</li>
  </ul>
